// 2.8 The Stock-Level Transaction
//
// The Stock-Level business transaction determines the number of recently sold
// items that have a stock level below a specified threshold. It represents a
// heavy read-only database transaction with a low frequency of execution, a
// relaxed response time requirement, and relaxed consistency requirements.

// 2.8.2.3 states:
// Full serializability and repeatable reads are not required for the
// Stock-Level business transaction. All data read must be committed and no
// older than the most recently committed data prior to the time this business
// transaction was initiated. All other ACID properties must be maintained.
// TODO(jordan): can we take advantage of this?

	// This data must all be returned by the transaction. See 2.8.3.4.
